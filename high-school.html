      <p>At the time I am making this I am a junior student at CodeRVA Regional High School here in Richmond, Va. I am a part of the few students and staff who have been here since the beginning of the school itself and I am also going to be a part of the first ever graduating class for the school! The reason being is that this is a new school and it only has been in session for about 2 years and I have been here since the start.</p>
      <p>Before coming here I had no idea about this coding world. I knew how to use a google and youtube but that was it. With that being said, it has been a challenge, but, it has also been pretty fun. I first started learning code with this program called Turtle graphics. Then in my junior year I moved on to Python. Towards the end of my junior year I started a in school internship and here I learned about html and css as well as some other things in this field.</p>
      <p>Again, I am a junior right now so I still have one more year of highschool. But for now, check out what I did during my first internship!</p>
